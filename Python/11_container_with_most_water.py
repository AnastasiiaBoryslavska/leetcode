#You are given an integer array height of length n. 
#There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
#Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
#Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
#Notice that you may not slant the container.
