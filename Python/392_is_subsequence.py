#Given two strings s and t, return true if s is a subsequence of t, or false otherwise.
#A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde" while "aec" is not).

#Example 1:

#Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
#Output: true

class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        i = j = 0

        while i < len(s) and j < len(t):
            if s[i] == t[j]:
                i += 1
            j += 1

        return i == len(s)
