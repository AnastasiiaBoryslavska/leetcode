'''
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums of length n. You are initially positioned at index 0.
Each element nums[i] represents the maximum length of a forward jump from index i. In other words, if you are at index i, you can jump to any index (i + j) where:
0 <= j <= nums[i] and
i + j < n
Return the minimum number of jumps to reach index n - 1. The test cases are generated such that you can reach index n - 1.

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.

class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        near = far = jumps = 0

        while far < len(nums) - 1:
            farthest = 0
            for i in range(near, far + 1):
                farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
            
            near = far + 1
            far = farthest
            jumps += 1
        
        return jumps
