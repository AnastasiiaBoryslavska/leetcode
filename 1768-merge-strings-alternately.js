/**
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
*/

/**
 * @param {string} word1
 * @param {string} word2
 * @return {string}

    let result = "";
    for(let i = 0; i < Math.max(word1.length, word2.length); i++) {
