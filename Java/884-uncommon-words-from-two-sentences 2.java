/**
 A sentence is a string of single-space separated words where each word consists only of lowercase letters.

A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

Given two sentences s1 and s2, return a list of all the uncommon words. You may return the answer in any order.

Example 1:

Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]

class Solution {
    public String[] uncommonFromSentences(String s1, String s2) {
        Map<String, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (String w : (s1 + " " + s2).split(" "))
            count.put(w, count.getOrDefault(w, 0) + 1);
        ArrayList<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String w : count.keySet())
            if (count.get(w) == 1)
                res.add(w);
        return res.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
