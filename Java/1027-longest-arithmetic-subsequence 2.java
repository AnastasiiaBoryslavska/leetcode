/**
Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.

Note that:

A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
 
Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,6,9,12]
Output: 4
Explanation:  The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with steps of length = 3.
