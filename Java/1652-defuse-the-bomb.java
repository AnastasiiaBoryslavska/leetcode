/**
You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array code of length of n and a key k.

To decrypt the code, you must replace every number. All the numbers are replaced simultaneously.

If k > 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the next k numbers.
If k < 0, replace the ith number with the sum of the previous k numbers.
If k == 0, replace the ith number with 0.
As code is circular, the next element of code[n-1] is code[0], and the previous element of code[0] is code[n-1].

Given the circular array code and an integer key k, return the decrypted code to defuse the bomb!

Example 1:

Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each number is replaced by the sum of the next 3 numbers. The decrypted code is [7+1+4, 1+4+5, 4+5+7, 5+7+1]. Notice that the numbers wrap around.
